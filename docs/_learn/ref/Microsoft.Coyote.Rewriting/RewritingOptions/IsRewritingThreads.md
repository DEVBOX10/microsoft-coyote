# RewritingOptions.IsRewritingThreads property

True if rewriting Threads as controlled tasks.

```csharp
public bool IsRewritingThreads { get; }
```

## Remarks

Normally Thread is not supported by Coyote, but this experimental feature wraps the thread in a Task so that Coyote knows about it which avoids uncontrolled concurrency errors in some cases.
